                            arguably
                            the most gifted musician in the history of classical music. Born in Salzburg, he was
                            already considered a genius as a child. He made his first attempts at composition at
                            the
                            tender age of six. His
                            inspiration is often described as "divine", but he worked assiduously, not only to
                            become the great composer he was, but also a conductor, virtuoso pianist, organist
                            and
                            violinist. The music of Mozart embraces opera, symphony, concerto, chamber, choral,
                            instrumental and vocal music, revealing an astonishing number of imperishable
                            masterpieces.</p>`;
