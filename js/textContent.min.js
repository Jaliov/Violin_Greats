document.getElementById("Mozart").innerHTML=' <p><span class="text-light">Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart </span>(1756 - 1791) was\n                            arguably\n                            the most gifted musician in the history of classical music. Born in Salzburg, he was\n                            already considered a genius as a child. He made his first attempts at composition at\n                            the\n                            tender age of six. His\n                            inspiration is often described as "divine", but he worked assiduously, not only to\n                            become the great composer he was, but also a conductor, virtuoso pianist, organist\n                            and\n                            violinist. The music of Mozart embraces opera, symphony, concerto, chamber, choral,\n                            instrumental and vocal music, revealing an astonishing number of imperishable\n                            masterpieces.</p>';
