His works rank amongst the most performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition from the classical period to the romantic era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. In musical form he was a considerable innovator, widening the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto, and quartet, while in the Ninth Symphony he combined the worlds of vocal and instrumental music in a manner never before attempted. His personal life was marked by a heroic struggle against encroaching deafness, and some of his most important works were composed during the last 10 years of his life when he was quite unable to hear. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="col-9 align-self-center"> <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapseExample22"> <div class="card card-body bg-dark text-danger"> Ludwig van Beethoven composed his Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 61, in 1806.

He indulged excessively in gambling and romantic love affairs and at one point pawned his violin because of gambling debts; a French merchant lent him a Guarneri violin to play a concert and, after hearing him, gave him the instrument. Between 1801 and 1807 he wrote his famous 24 Capricci for unaccompanied violin, and the two sets of six sonatas for violin and guitar. He later gave recitals of his own compositions in many towns in Italy. In 1828 Paganini experienced great success in Vienna, and his appearances in Paris and London in 1831 were equally sensational. His tour of England and Scotland in 1832 made him a wealthy man. His other works include 6 violin concertos; 12 sonatas for violin and guitar; and 6 quartets for violin, viola, cello, and guitar.

In his music Mendelssohn largely observed Classical models and practices while initiating key aspects of Romanticisn - the artistic movement that exalted feeling and the imagination above rigid forms and traditions. Among his most famous works are Overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826), Italian Symphony (1833), the violin concerto (1844), two piano concerti (1831, 1837), the oratorio Elijah (1846), and several pieces of chamber music. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="col-9 align-self-center"> <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="multiCollapseExample28"> <div class="card card-body bg-dark text-danger"> <p>The <span class="text-light">Violin Concerto in E Minor, Op. 64, concerto for violin and orchestra by Felix Mendelssohn</span>, is one of the most lyrical and flowing works of its type and one of the most frequently performed of all violin concerti.
