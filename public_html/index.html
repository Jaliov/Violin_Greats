                                for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg

                                1992) was a Russian and American virtuoso violinist. Widely considered
                                one of the
                                greatest violinists of the 20th century, Milstein was
                                known for his interpretations of Bach's solo violin works and for works from the
                                Romantic period. He was also known for his long career: he performed at a high level
                                into his mid-80s, retiring only after suffering an injured hand. His natural, relaxed

                                virtuoso technique and artistry. Perlman contracted polio at age four, which left his
                                legs paralyzed. His first public concert was in Tel Aviv when he was 10. In 1958 he went
                                to the United States to study at the Juilliard School in New York City with the renowned
                                teachers Ivan Galamian and Dorothy DeLay; in that same year he performed before a
                                national television audience on the Ed Sullivan Show. He made his Carnegie Hall (New

                                brought him immediate engagements with major American orchestras. He is still peforming

                                was a
                                German composer and pianist. Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in
                                the history of Western music. His works rank amongst the most performed of the
                                classical music repertoire and span the transition from the classical period to the
                                romantic era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into
                                early, middle, and late periods. In musical form he was a considerable innovator,
                                widening the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto, and quartet, while in the Ninth
                                Symphony he combined the worlds of vocal and instrumental music in a manner never
                                before attempted. His personal life was marked by a heroic struggle against
                                encroaching deafness, and some of his most important works were composed during the
                                last 10 years of his life when he was quite unable to hear. </p>

                                revolutionized violin technique! He indulged excessively in gambling and romantic

                                him a Guarneri violin to play a concert and, after hearing him, gave him the
                                instrument.
                                Between 1801 and 1807 he wrote his famous 24 Capricci for unaccompanied violin, and
                                the
                                two
                                sets of six sonatas for violin and guitar. He later gave recitals of his own

                                many towns in Italy. In 1828 Paganini experienced great success in Vienna, and his
                                appearances in Paris and London in 1831 were equally sensational. His tour of

                                12
                                sonatas for violin and guitar; and 6 quartets for violin, viola, cello, and guitar.

                                influence of his virtuosity has extended to orchestral as well as to piano music.

                                Sibelius,
                                (Dec. 8, 1865 - Sept. 20, 1957),
                                was a Finnish composer of the late Romantic period. His music played an important
                                role
                                in
                                the
                                formation of the Finnish national identity. The core of his oeuvre is his set of
                                seven
                                symphonies. Like Beethoven, Sibelius used each successive work to further develop
                                his
                                own
                                personal compositional style. His works continue to be performed frequently in the
                                concert
                                hall
                                and are often recorded. In addition to the symphonies, Sibelius&#039;s best-known
                                compositions
                                include &quot;Finlandia&quot;, the &quot;Karelia Suite&quot;, &quot;Valse
                                triste&quot;,
                                the
                                Violin Concerto presented here &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot;</p>

                                originally composed in 1904 and revised
                                in 1905, is the only concerto by Sibelius. It is symphonic in scope and included an
                                extended
                                cadenza for the soloist that takes on the role of the development section in the
                                first
                                movement.
                                The premier of the concerto in its initial form was a bit of disaster. The work was
                                then

                                Although, originally its technical demands were considered daunting, it is today a
                                staple of
